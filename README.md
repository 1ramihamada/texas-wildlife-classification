# Texas Wildlife Image Classification Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of wildlife native to Texas. The project is documented to provide a step-by-step guide on how to build, train, and evaluate an image classification model.

## Objectives
- Develop a CNN to classify images of Texas wildlife.
- Achieve reasonable accuracy in classification.
- Document the process thoroughly for educational and professional purposes.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from:
- [US Fish and Wildlife Service Open Data](https://gis-fws.opendata.arcgis.com/)
- [Texas Parks and Wildlife Department](https://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/maps/gis/)

### Dataset Details
- **Classes:** Various species of wildlife native to Texas.
- **Image Dimensions:** 32x32 pixels (for example, if using a standardized dataset like CIFAR-10 for the initial model).
- **Number of Images:** Approximately 60,000 images (assuming a dataset similar to CIFAR-10).

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/texas-wildlife-classification.git
